    until you reach to finish button and finally press finish button.
    From the Android Studio Welcome screen, select 'More Actions' -> 'Virtual Device Manager'.
    Now press on "Create device" -> A new screen will open -> Choose a device like "Pixel 6" -> Finish setup.
    It will redirect you again on Virtual Device Manager screen(i.e. where "Create device" button was there). 
    Choose the device you created in previous step and click on play button.
    It will create and setup Andriod Emulator on your system. Now you can view your project by pressing "a" in your
    PC(i.e. system) terminal where you are running your react native project. 
    You can also use "expo url" printed on your screen to connect to Andriod emulator which seems like - exp://192.168.1.8:19000
    You can also use your andriod phone as emulator. For that You will just have to install and open "Expo Go" app on 
    your andriod app and in that app you can either scan the QR code printed on your terminal or use "expo url" to connect.


    How to open Debug menu in Andriod emulator :
    If you are running the android emulator on your PC then open your Android Emulator and press 'Command + M' 
    on macOS or 'Ctrl + M' on Linux and Windows from the PC keyboard. And if you are running the android emulator 
    on your android phone then just shake your phone and the Debug menu will be open.
